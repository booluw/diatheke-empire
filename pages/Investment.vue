        <p class="section__paragraph">
          Agricultural investment is a prerequisite for Africa's agricultural economy to thrive and organize. In terms of intensification of production and structuring of agricultural value chains, Africa's agricultural potential presents chances to be grabbed. Agricultural investment (public, private, and international) remains weak, despite its diversification. The transition to a contemporary, intensive mode of agriculture necessitates the establishment of a comprehensive agricultural policy that considers a number of factors (irrigation, use of inputs and organization of marketing facilities). It should eventually lead to sufficient agricultural production that ensures population food security, as well as an active agricultural sector that is well integrated into African countries' economies.

        <p class="section__paragraph">
          Obtaining an education is more than a basic human right. It's critical for expanding job and income prospects. It is critical to breaking the poverty cycle. For all Africans, education is the key to unlocking the golden door of freedom. It is the foundation of social and economic progress. Education is essential because it is a form of human capital investment. This has enormous implications on a variety of levels and sectors. It is beneficial to the person, the family, the community, and the country. Education is a long-term solution to poverty alleviation and long-term transformation. As a result, any endeavor to bring about long-term change must incorporate education in some form.

          Providing children with a high-quality education reflects the reality that every child has fundamental human rights and should be treated with respect. Poverty, violence, abuse, exploitation, and other unpleasant outcomes arise when children do not have access to education. High dropout rates are a result of poverty and the obstacles that come with it. As a result, one of Develop Africa's missions is to provide chances for bright but disadvantaged African children and youth.

        <p class="section__paragraph">
          Unfortunately, for destitute or underprivileged households in Africa, obtaining a quality education is difficult. The supportive environment has a significant impact on the quality of education that children get. This environment includes access to essential learning materials - books and school supplies. A supportive environment also includes consistent financial support so that kids can depend on being able to go to school, and finish their education.
